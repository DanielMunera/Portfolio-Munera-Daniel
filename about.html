        I graduated in 2024 from the University of North Texas with an Integrative Studies Degree. The three fields I studied were Communications, Spanish, and Technical Communication.

I went graduated with my associates degree from North Central Texas College in 2022. I spent my first year at UNT focusing on writing and learning Spanish. I knowing other languages can help you express ideas in different ways and helps me write in English. I spent my senior year focusing on Technical communication and learning different software like InDesign, Canva, Hubspot, and Logic Pro X. (The last one was an elective, I like to learn as much as I can.)
